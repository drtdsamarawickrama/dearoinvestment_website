            <p class="text-theme-gray text-md font-normal text-left w-full mt-2">Project financing is a specialised skill. It requires a blend of industry knowledge and financial expertise in order to evaluate the undertaking and structure the optimal funding package for the enterprise. As the project’s cash flows are a primary consideration, the evaluation process will include a validation of the project’s feasibility with regard to several aspects such as the sponsor’s track record, the market, technology and production, management and human resources, the environment, regulations and statutory approvals. The optimal means of finance would then be determined including the sponsor’s contribution and gearing level, the loan tenure and repayment plan, and the credit enhancements that may be required. In certain cases where justified, the project financing may be in the form of preference shares.</p>
