                    Hotels and resorts, Manufacture Industries, shopping centers, and even any Business, are projects often funded by joint venture loans.  This type of financing is created through an affiliation in which both parties agree to share capital, risks and rewards of the venture.  It is different from a partnership in that it relates solely to a particular project, but for the most part, the agreement looks very much like that of a formal partnership.

                    What investors look for is the potential for profit, which must be clearly outlined in a comprehensive business plan.  As a borrower, you will also need to demonstrate that your project has a percentage of the equity invested in cash, or that you have real equity to back up the loan.
